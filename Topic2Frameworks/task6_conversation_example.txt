Example Multi-Model Conversation with Chat History
====================================================

This demonstrates how the system handles three entities (Human, Llama, Qwen)
using the Message API with name prefixes.

Conversation:
-------------

> What is the best ice cream flavor?

[Llama] Processing with chat history...
[DEBUG] Conversation length: 1 messages

Llama Response:
--------------------------------------------------
There is no one best flavor, as taste is subjective. However, vanilla is
the most popular flavor worldwide due to its versatility and classic appeal.

> Hey Qwen, what do you think?

[Qwen] Processing with chat history...
[DEBUG] Conversation length: 2 messages

Qwen Response:
--------------------------------------------------
No way! Chocolate is definitely the best ice cream flavor. It's rich, creamy,
and has that perfect balance of sweetness and depth. Vanilla is too plain.

> I agree with Qwen

[Llama] Processing with chat history...
[DEBUG] Conversation length: 3 messages

Llama Response:
--------------------------------------------------
I understand you prefer chocolate. While I mentioned vanilla's popularity,
chocolate is indeed a wonderful choice with its rich flavor profile. Both
flavors have their merits, and personal preference is what matters most.

Observations:
-------------
1. Each model sees the full conversation history
2. Models can reference previous responses from other models
3. The system maintains context across model switches
4. Name prefixes (Human:, Llama:, Qwen:) allow proper role assignment
5. System prompts are model-specific, explaining the multi-agent setup

This demonstrates effective multi-agent conversation management using LangGraph
and the Message API.
